# Main take aways

This project took me a bit longer to understand the API context working with EF core. I feel the next projects will be easier to understand now that i have a basis
for Entity Framework. That said, server connections and sql databases links with the code are still some of my weakest points that i will need to continue working on since they are so vital.
